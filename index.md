Let me share a story of mine as a programmer. 

I have enjoyed coding since I was in high school. The first programming language that I learned is HTML/CSS which was introduced by my IT teacher. Since then, the chemistry of me and computer had improved and I saw a bright future for me as a programmer. My current goal is to study deeper about computer science and find my area of expertise. Besides that, I already knew that my long-term goal is to grow the technology in my birth country, Indonesia.  

My motivation quote is from Walt Disney:

> “The Best Way To Get Started Is To Quit Talking And Begin Doing.” – Walt Disney 

This is a simple code to create a navigation bar with HTML
```
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="/w3css/3/w3.css">
 <body>

<!-- Navigation -->
<nav class="w3-bar w3-black">
  <a href="#home" class="w3-button w3-bar-item">Home</a>
  <a href="#band" class="w3-button w3-bar-item">Band</a>
  <a href="#tour" class="w3-button w3-bar-item">Tour</a>
  <a href="#contact" class="w3-button w3-bar-item">Contact</a>
</nav>

</body>

```
