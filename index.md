Let me share a story of mine as a programmer. 

I have enjoyed coding since I was in high school. The first programming language that I learned is HTML/CSS which was introduced by my IT teacher. Since then, the chemistry of me and computer had improved and I saw a bright future for me as a programmer. My current goal is to study deeper about computer science and find my area of expertise. Besides that, I already knew that my long-term goal is to grow the technology in my birth country, Indonesia.  

My current programming language knowledge:
 - C++
 - JAVA
 - HTML/CSS/Javascript
 - R
 - React
